This application alters the default loadout in Hogs of War

Currently in the test build, the application *should* support
binary (.bin) files for NTSC/USA and PAL/Europe ROMS
as well as the respective executable files that are housed inside these ROMS.
The application also supports the PC version of the game.

Once a file is loaded, the user is free to alter weapons, health, speed etc.
Pig speed variations seem to be disabled in the NTSC version.

Application allows for "spritesheets" to be exported from the inventory.
These same files can then be loaded back into any pig class for convenience.

I recommend backing up any files you use as a precaution

If you find any bugs or find a ROM that is currently incompatible
let me know so I can fix issues/add compatibility
